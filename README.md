# Log of Resolving this technical test

First i would like to thank for being able to do this technical test, which i found it thrilling, interesting and entertaining to do it.

When i began doing it i focused on calling the api, and then rendering the elements of the array. I did some tries before realizing why it gave errors but after 10 mins i realized it and kept on bringing out the different elements: date, gender, street, etc. Then i started with the button of toggling but since i got them all inside the same state whenever i clicked on it it showed the information of all, which i didnt intend. Then i tried it with sending the information to another component through props and a function. When i finished that i began with the css using tailwind and added a Navbar and a Footer. Since there were no several children but just one i decided to do it though props.
